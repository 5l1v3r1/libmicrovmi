## Overview

`libmicrovmi` simply aims to provide a cross-platform unified API and the necessary drivers to be
compatible with the diversity of hypervisors available today.

Its main goal is to solve the problem of [`libvmi`](https://github.com/libvmi/libvmi) being written in `C` and a
Linux-centered library, not yet ready to offer drivers for other platforms such
as Windows and MacOS.

It doesn't aim to **replace** `libvmi`, since it doesn't implement features like rekall profile parsing or operating system knowledge, but rather to provide a foundation for high-level VMI libraries.

The term micro (Î¼) refers to the library's simplicity as well as the letter `U`
standing for `Unified` interface.

The grand goal is to be the foundation for a VMI abstraction library that will
be
- multi-hypervisor
- multi-emulator
- cross-plaform
- high-level

So that it provides the necessary abstractions and semantic context to let
developers focus on building VMI apps.

## VMI API

* Query and modify the VM hardware state
    - read/write VCPU registers
    - read/write physical memory
* Subscribe and listen to hardware events
    - mov to/from CR3/CR8
    - mov to/from DRx
    - mov to/from MSR
    - interrupts
    - singlestep (MTF)
    - hypercalls
    - descriptors
    - SLAT (Second Level Address Translation) events
        - `r/w/x` event on a page
        - dynamically switch to multiple memory _views_ using alternate SLAT pointers
- Utilities
    - foreign mapping
    - pagefault injection

## Requirements

- `Rust` stable
- `cargo`

## Build

To build the library, simply run

    cargo build

By default, only the `Dummy` driver will be available (it does nothing).

To enable a driver, for example `xen`, enable the corresponding feature
(`Cargo.toml`)

    cargo build --features xen

## Example

### mem-dump

A small binary is available to demonstrate what the `libmicrovmi` can do: `mem-dump`

Edit `src/bin/mem-dump.rs` and replace the `Dummy` driver type by the one you
want.

(hypervisor autodetection is not implemented yet)

For example with Xen
~~~Rust
// replace
let drv_type = DriverType::Dummy;
// by
let drv_type = DriverType::Xen;
~~~

~~~
$ cargo build --features xen
$ ./target/debug/mem-dump winxp
~~~

A memory dump should have been written in `winxp.dump`.

### API example

~~~Rust
// select drive type (Dummy, Xen, KVM, ...)
let drv_type = DriverType::Dummy;
// init library
let mut drv: Box<dyn Introspectable> = microvmi::init(drv_type, domain_name);
// pause VM
drv.pause()
    .expect("Failed to pause VM");
// get max physical address
let max_addr = drv.get_max_physical_addr()
                    .expect("Failed to get max physical address");
// read physical memory
let mut buffer: [u8; 4096] = [0; 4096];
let result = drv.read_physical(0x804d7000, &mut buffer);
// resume VM
drv.resume()
    .expect("Failed to resume VM");
~~~

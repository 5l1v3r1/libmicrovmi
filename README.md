## Overview

`libmicrovmi` simply aims to provide a cross-platform unified API and the necessary drivers to be
compatible with the diversity of hypervisors available today.

Its main goal is to solve the problem of [`libvmi`](https://github.com/libvmi/libvmi) being written in `C` and a
Linux-centered library, not yet ready to offer drivers for other platforms such
as Windows and MacOS.

It doesn't aim to **replace** `libvmi`, since it doesn't implement features like rekall profile parsing or operating system knowledge, but rather to provide a foundation for high-level VMI libraries.

The term micro (Î¼) refers to the library's simplicity as well as the letter `U`
standing for `Unified` interface.

## VMI API

* Query and modify the VM hardware state
    - read/write VCPU registers
    - read/write physical memory
* Subscribe and listen to hardware events
    - mov to/from CR3/CR8
    - mov to/from DRx
    - mov to/from MSR
    - interrupts
    - singlestep (MTF)
    - SLAT (Second Level Address Translation) events
        - `r/w/x` event on a page
        - dynamically switch to multiple memory _views_ using alternate SLAT pointers
- Utilities
    - pagefault injection

## Requirements

- `cargo`
